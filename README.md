# a Christmas Puzzle 

Good news everyone ( <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1D1cap6yETA> ) it is Christmas and you are bored.
No worries we have a puzzle for you! Prove your resourcefulness, quick mind and that you have
too much free time! :) Follow the gingerbread crumbs and make all the mysterious tests green!
When you feel that you're ready, tweet the url of your repository to @javarebel with the hashtag \#xmaspuzzle

Your mission, should you decide to accept it is to write a function so that all the tests in
this repository pass. You can test that by typing

`gradle test`

Can you make it pass? A bunch of if-statements is a good beginning, however...
